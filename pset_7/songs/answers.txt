(1) Let's look at the average energy, valence, and danceability of songs.db.
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs; --> 0.65906
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs; --> 0.484443
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs; --> 0.71646
As such, their audio aura would be characterized by these values. I'd probably give them pink
since their energy/danceability is above average (0.5), but not so much for their valence.

(2) The way I've calculated this aura might not be very representative of this listener because
it only considers 3 of the factors of the songs; it doesn't look at tempo or energy or artist or genre.
As such, the analysis is limited in its scope. A better way of calculating this aura would be
to consider more of the other factors mentioned above, like tempo, energy, artist, or genre.
