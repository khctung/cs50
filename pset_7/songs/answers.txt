Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs
from the past year. In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user,
a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as dictated by [their] top songs and artists
of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy,
valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
