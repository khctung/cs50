                    <td>I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately decided to go with 3. To start, it is WAY too sweet. Unfortunately, the sugar is part of Starbucks' matcha powder, so if I wanted less sugar, I'd also get less matcha. I will deduct a star for the price because it's just not good enough to justify the $5+ I spent on a SMALL cup of coffee. The flavor is decent, though.</td>
