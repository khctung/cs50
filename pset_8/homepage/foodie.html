                    <td>I'm actually sad about giving this one such a low rating, but it had to be done. The taste itself is actually quite authentic, but a little too milky/diluted for my taste. Also, they expect you to add your own sweetener, but it just doesn't do it for me. It ends up being bland, and whatever sugar I add in tastes artificial. Plus, it's a bit of a walk to get there and it's also not cheap either.</td>

                    <td>I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately decided to go with 3. To start, it is WAY too sweet. Unfortunately, the sugar is part of Starbucks' matcha powder, so if I wanted less sugar, I'd also get less matcha. I will deduct a star for the price because it's just not good enough to justify the $5+ I spent on a SMALL cup of coffee. The flavor is decent, though.</td>

                    <td>Genuinely one of the worst matcha lattes I've tried before. Would have given it a one star if it weren't for the fact that the caffeine actually keeps me awake. The matcha flavor is not even close to what actual matcha tastes like, and the sweetener they use just does not complement the flavor. To be honest, I think Tatte as a whole is overrated, and their matcha latte just reflects that.</td>
