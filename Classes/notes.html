HTML Notes

router = send info from point a to point b
internet = can route across/down servers -> dynamic
packet = generic name for information
TCP/IP = 2 protocols that the internet uses to get data from point a to b
IP = internet protocol = standardizes how the addresses work
--> every computer/internet device has a IP address (unique string that identifies computers)
--> #.#.#.# -- each number is between 0 and 255; so 8 bits/1 byte per number; 2^32 = 4 billion unique numbers
--> provides source and destination address

TCP = pair of protocols that gets us from point a to b, guarantees delivery via writing a sequence number, helps servers do more than one thing
--> gives us port numbers
--> common port numbers: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS, secure version of HTTP)
--> sequence numbers are really big (using up all 32 bits)

domain names = wix.com
DNS = domain-name-system servers
--> answers what ip address is for the domain name (numeric address)
--> dictionary: fully qualified domain name (key) -> ip address (values)
--> ask local, then bigger, then eventually root systems

DHCP = dynamic host configuration protocol
--> what should be by DNS server and router?
--> HTTP = worldwide web = protocol that governs how web browsers and servers speak
--> for web, standardizes what goes inside the envelope
--> HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol

HTTPS = secure version of HTTP (secure version that prevents interceptors)
https://www.example.com/path --> something a page inside
                   ^ / = root, default page/folder for website
https://www.example.com/folder/file.html --> file, usually doesn't have html there
         ^ full domain name, includes www
         ^ www = host name

GET = getting information
POST = posting information

info sent from browser to server:
GET / HTTP/2
Host: www.harvard.edu
...

server sends back:
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: text/html

curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/
curl = connect to url
--> no pics or anything, just returning what the website is
301 = moved permanently
404 = page not found


HTML basics
tags =
attributes =

<!DOCTYPE html?

<html lang="en">

    <title>
      hello, title
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Visit <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>.
    <video controls muted>
        <source src=""video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    <img alt="name of photo" src="bridge.png">
    <table>
      <tr> <!-- table row -->
        <td>1</td> <!-- cell -->
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <!-- unordered list -->
    <ul>
      <li>foo</li>
      <li>bar</li>
      <li>baz</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- ordered list (w numbers) -->
    <ol>
      <li>foo</li>
      <li>bar</li>
      <li>baz</li>
    </ol>
    hello, body
  </body>
</html>

--> allows for server to display the info
http-server -> listens to http requests
--> directory listing
