HTML Notes

router = send info from point a to point b
internet = can route across/down servers -> dynamic
packet = generic name for information
TCP/IP = 2 protocols that the internet uses to get data from point a to b
IP = internet protocol = standardizes how the addresses work
--> every computer/internet device has a IP address (unique string that identifies computers)
--> #.#.#.# -- each number is between 0 and 255; so 8 bits/1 byte per number; 2^32 = 4 billion unique numbers
--> provides source and destination address

TCP = pair of protocols that gets us from point a to b, guarantees delivery via writing a sequence number, helps servers do more than one thing
--> gives us port numbers
--> common port numbers: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS, secure version of HTTP)
--> sequence numbers are really big (using up all 32 bits)

domain names = wix.com
DNS = domain-name-system servers
--> answers what ip address is for the domain name (numeric address)
--> dictionary: fully qualified domain name (key) -> ip address (values)
--> ask local, then bigger, then eventually root systems

DHCP = dynamic host configuration protocol
--> what should be by DNS server and router?
--> HTTP = worldwide web = protocol that governs how web browsers and servers speak
--> for web, standardizes what goes inside the envelope
--> HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol

HTTPS = secure version of HTTP (secure version that prevents interceptors)
https://www.example.com/path --> something a page inside
                   ^ / = root, default page/folder for website
https://www.example.com/folder/file.html --> file, usually doesn't have html there
         ^ full domain name, includes www
         ^ www = host name
https://www.example.com/path?key=value&key=value

GET = getting information
POST = posting information

info sent from browser to server:
GET / HTTP/2
Host: www.harvard.edu
...

server sends back:
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: text/html

curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/
curl = connect to url
--> no pics or anything, just returning what the website is
301 = moved permanently
404 = page not found
